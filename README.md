# PDF_Answering_ai

#### This project enables efficient extraction, preprocessing, and querying of text content from PDF documents. Leveraging various embedding models, the system allows users to upload PDFs, input queries, and retrieve the most relevant text segments through a user-friendly interface.

### Introduction

#### The PDF_Answering_ai extracts and prepares text from PDF documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various embedding models. It enables users to query and retrieve relevant text content efficiently via a Streamlit interface.

### Features

#### ->PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text from PDFs using the fitz library.
#### ->NLP Preprocessing: Preprocesses text with tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization, and punctuation removal.
#### ->Embedding Models: Supports multiple embedding models including Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText and BERT.
#### ->User Interface: Simple Streamlit interface for uploading PDFs, inputting questions, and selecting embedding models.
#### ->Answer Retrieval: Finds and presents the most relevant sentences in response to user queries.

### Installation

#### Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ideal-guy/PDf_answering_ai.git
```

#### Create the Directory:
```bash
mkdir -p static
```

#### Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run pdf_ans.py
```

### Methodology

#### PDF Text Extraction
#### Text is extracted from PDF documents using the fitz library (PyMuPDF). This ensures that text from various PDF formats is accurately captured for further processing.

#### Text Preprocessing
#### The extracted text undergoes preprocessing to prepare it for analysis:
#### -> Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
#### -> Stop Word Removal: Removing common words that do not carry significant meaning.
#### -> Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or dictionary form.
#### -> Punctuation Removal: Eliminating punctuation marks to clean the text.

#### Text Embedding Models
#### The system applies various embedding models to generate numerical representations of the text:
#### -> Word2Vec (Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram)
#### -> GloVe
#### -> FastText
#### -> BERT

#### These models transform text into vectors, allowing for efficient similarity computations.

### User Interaction
#### The Streamlit interface provides a simple platform for users to interact with the system:
#### ->Upload PDFs
#### ->Input Questions
#### ->Select Embedding Models

### Answer Generation
#### Based on the chosen embedding model, the system computes similarity between the user's query and the sentences in the document. The most relevant sentences are then displayed as answers.

### Results
#### The PDF_Answering_ai accurately retrieves the most relevant sentences from PDF documents in response to user queries, providing precise and informative answers.
